# belly-button-biodiversity-dashboard

### Introduction
How much do you pay attention to your belly buttons and how clean are they? Today, we are here to find out the microbes that colonize our navels.

In this nice dashboard, we will be able to use various interactive charts to explore the microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) that live in your belly buttons. 

### Insturction
This dashboard is primarily made by using the *Plotly* function. It basically reads in the dataset using D3 library, and plots different informational and interactive charts using Plotly. 

Here are some documents that you can refer to:
1. [samples.json](https://github.com/Grace-Bijun-Li/belly-button-biodiversity-dashboard/blob/main/Code/samples.json)
    - This is the dataset that contains the OTUs that were present in more than 70% of people.
2. [app.js](https://github.com/Grace-Bijun-Li/belly-button-biodiversity-dashboard/blob/main/Code/static/js/app.js)
    - This is the main JS script that deploys the *Plotly* functions.
3. [index.html](https://github.com/Grace-Bijun-Li/belly-button-biodiversity-dashboard/blob/main/Code/index.html)
    - This is the template that takes the *app.js* codes and display them into the final dashboard.
